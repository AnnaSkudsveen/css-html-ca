### Problems and struggles
I really struggled with getting the navbar to look correct, and I struggled with making it sit on top of the hero-banner. And the sticky position only works so far down the site.

### Learning outcomes - Stack
HTML
CSS

### Looking forward to
Learning Javascript. I really look forward to see how I can make a couple of these things actully work, as well as a better way of making a navbar
