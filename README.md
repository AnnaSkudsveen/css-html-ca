### Problems and struggles
I really struggled with getting te navbar to look correct, and then I struggled with making it sit on top of the hero-banner. And the sticky position only works so far down the site.

### Learning outcomes
I finally figured out different ways of getting images to scale properly and to get them positioned where I wanted them.
I found that I learned a lot in the course that I just needed to hammer down to get it to stick, so this was a great way to make everything stick.

### Looking forward to
Learning Javascript. I really look forward to see how I can make a couple of these things actully work, as well as a better way of making a navbar
